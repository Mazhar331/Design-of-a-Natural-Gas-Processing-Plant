# Design-of-a-Natural-Gas-Processing-Plant
– Used DW-SIM to design and simulate a natural gas processing plant of capacity 10 MMSCFD (simulation iles attached).
– The equipment was sized, the plant was costed and a break-even analysis was performed (details in report).
– The design’s robustness in the face of process uncertainties was evaluated with the help of a sensitivity analysis (excel sheet contains sensitivity data).
– A Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study was also conducted (HAZOP worksheet attached separately).
